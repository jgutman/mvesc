# Descriptive Analysis

This directory contains codes, scripts, and figures used to explore the results to our model runs. None of this code is necessary to run models, but may be useful to gather a better understanding of the output. Some of these scrips may be incomplete.

Many of these jupyter notebooks and R scripts rely on the features, outcomes, and modeling results being in the `model` schema.
