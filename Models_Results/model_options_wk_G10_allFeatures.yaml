### yaml demo file for mvesc
# Simple Rules
# - very similiar to json / dict
# - allow inline comment with #; no block comment options
# - use space; no TAB
# - number of spaces does NOT matter; keep keys hierarchically aligned
# - at least 1 space after ':', '-'
# - load it in Python:
#   ```
#   import yaml
#   with open('model_options.yaml', 'r') as f:
#       model_options = yaml.load(f)
#   ```
##  Then you can use it as a dictionary
##  Loaded dict is in alphabetical order; but no content is changed
model_classes_selected: [logit, DT, SVM, RF, GB, KNN] # [SVM] # must be a list of strings!
