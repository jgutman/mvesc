### yaml demo file for mvesc
# Simple Rules
# - very similiar to json / dict
# - allow inline comment with #; no block comment options
# - use space; no TAB
# - number of spaces does NOT matter; keep keys hierarchically aligned
# - at least 1 space after ':', '-'
# - load it in Python:
#   ```
#   import yaml
#   with open('model_options.yaml', 'r') as f:
#       model_options = yaml.load(f)
#   ```
##  Then you can use it as a dictionary
##  Loaded dict is in alphabetical order; but no content is changed
model_classes_selected: [logit, DT, SVM] # word is parsed as string
user_description: initial_skeleton_pipeline_test # this isn't currently used?
file_save_name: gender_ethnicity # model name and extension appended automatically

parameter_cross_validation_scheme: leave_cohort_out #k_fold
cohort_grade_level_begin: cohort_9th
n_folds: 10
cohorts_held_out: [2012]
# allowed values is all or a list of cohort years
cohorts_training: all # [2006, 2007, 2008, 2009]
random_seed: 2187 # number is parsed as number
validation_criterion: average_precision #f1

features_included: # model_options['features_included'] must be a dictionary
  demographics: [ethnicity, gender] # list of columns in brackets
  # grades: [high_school_gpa]
