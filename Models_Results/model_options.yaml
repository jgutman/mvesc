### yaml demo file for mvesc
# Simple Rules
# - very similiar to json / dict
# - allow inline comment with #; no block comment options
# - use space; no TAB
# - number of spaces does NOT matter; keep keys hierarchically aligned
# - at least 1 space after ':', '-'
# - load it in Python:
#   ```
#   import yaml
#   with open('model_options.yaml', 'r') as f:
#       model_options = yaml.load(f)
#   ```
##  Then you can use it as a dictionary
##  Loaded dict is in alphabetical order; but no content is changed
model_classes_selected: [logit, DT] # [SVM] # must be a list of strings!
user_description: initial_skeleton_pipeline_test # this isn't currently used?
# file_save_name: gender_ethnicity # model name and extension appended automatically
file_save_name: test_gpa_gender_ethnicity_imputed
write_predictions_to_database: False

model_test_holdout: temporal_cohort
parameter_cross_validation_scheme: leave_cohort_out #k_fold
cohort_grade_level_begin: cohort_9th
n_folds: 10
cohorts_held_out: [2011, 2012]

# allowed values for cohorts_training is 'all' or a list of cohort years
cohorts_training: all # [2006, 2007, 2008, 2009]
random_seed: 2187 # number is parsed as number
validation_criterion: accuracy # f1 # average_precision

# model_options['features_included'] must be a dictionary
features_included:
  demographics: [ethnicity, gender] # list of columns in brackets
  grades: [gpa_gr_3, gpa_gr_4, gpa_gr_5, gpa_gr_6, gpa_gr_7, gpa_gr_8, gpa_gr_9]

outcome_name: not_on_time
# currently implemented: impute numeric features with mean or median
# add dummy for numeric + categorical, no mode imputation for categorical
missing_impute_strategy: median_plus_dummies # mean_plus_dummies
feature_scaling: robust # none, standard, or robust options to be implemented
