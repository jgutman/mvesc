### yaml demo file for mvesc
# Simple Rules
# - very similiar to json / dict
# - allow inline comment with #; no block comment options
# - use space; no TAB
# - number of spaces does NOT matter; keep keys hierarchically aligned
# - at least 1 space after ':', '-'
# - load it in Python:
#   ```
#   import yaml
#   with open('model_options.yaml', 'r') as f:
#       model_options = yaml.load(f)
#   ```
##  Then you can use it as a dictionary
##  Loaded dict is in alphabetical order; but no content is changed
model_classes_selected: [logit, DT] # [SVM] # must be a list of strings!
user_description: expand features and grade range
# model name and extension appended automatically
file_save_name: testing_write_to_database
write_predictions_to_database: False

model_test_holdout: temporal_cohort
parameter_cross_validation_scheme: leave_cohort_out #k_fold
cohort_grade_level_begin: cohort_9th
prediction_grade_level: 10 # predicting at the beginning of this grade
feature_grade_range: [8, 9]
n_folds: 10
cohorts_held_out: [2011] # [2012 is ultimate test set not to be used here]

# allowed values for cohorts_training is 'all' or a list of cohort years
cohorts_training: [2009, 2010] # all
random_seed: 2187 # number is parsed as number
validation_criterion: custom_recall_10 # accuracy # f1 # average_precision

# model_options['features_included'] must be a dictionary
features_included:
  demographics: [ethnicity, gender] # list of columns in brackets
  grades: [gpa*, language_gpa*, stem_gpa*, humanities_gpa*,num_stem_classes*,num_language_classes*, num_humanities_classes*]
  mobility: [n_addresses_to*, n_cities_to*, n_districts_to*]
  snapshots: [disadvantagement*, disability*, district*, gifted*,
        iss*, oss*, limited_english*, special_ed*, status*,
        days_absent*, days_absent_unexcused*, discipline_incidents*]

outcome_name: definite
# currently implemented: impute numeric features with mean or median
# add dummy for numeric + categorical, no mode imputation for categorical
missing_impute_strategy: median_plus_dummies # mean_plus_dummies
feature_scaling: robust # none, standard, or robust options to be implemented
