# Prediction Modeling & Results

This folder contains the code to choose specific features to include, use those features for a prediction model, and save the results (both raw and summarized)

### Choosing Features to Include


### Estimating the Prediction Model


### Saving the Model Details & Results

For analysis and improvement of our models, it's important that we record all of
* the inputs and parameters used to estimate the prediction model
* the results of the prediction performance

We measure performance in several ways. [describe them. We primarily focus on precision and recall, especially because our early warning risk prediction problem is imbalanced, with a large majority of students not labeled as at risk.]
