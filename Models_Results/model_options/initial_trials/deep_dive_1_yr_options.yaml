### yaml demo file for mvesc
# Simple Rules
# - very similiar to json / dict
# - allow inline comment with #; no block comment options
# - use space; no TAB
# - number of spaces does NOT matter; keep keys hierarchically aligned
# - at least 1 space after ':', '-'
# - load it in Python:
#   ```
#   import yaml
#   with open('model_options.yaml', 'r') as f:
#       model_options = yaml.load(f)
#   ```
##  Then you can use it as a dictionary
##  Loaded dict is in alphabetical order; but no content is changed

model_classes_selected: [logit, DT, SVM] # must be a list of strings!

# allowed values for cohorts_training is 'all' or a list of cohort years

random_seed: 2187 # number is parsed as number
validation_criterion: custom_precision_10  #average_precision, accuracy, or f1

# model_options['features_included'] must be a dictionary
features_included:
  demographics: [ethnicity, gender] # list of columns in brackets

# currently implemented: impute numeric features with mean or median
# add dummy for numeric + categorical, no mode imputation for categorical

feature_scaling: robust # none, standard, or robust options to be implemented
