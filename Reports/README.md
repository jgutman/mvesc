# Output of Prediction Performance Reports

This folder contains automatically created, human readable reports from each time we estimate a predictive model. Here, we output a general summary of prediction performance and the inputs/parameters used.

This folder also contains a meta-report, which summarizes each of the individual reports too, for ease of understanding. Each individual run will be given a text summary description, which will be placed in this document for easy readability.
