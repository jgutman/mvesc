'''
Joint note from JG and ZZ:
This python file generates a SQL query to build a table tracking
students over time. Each column represents a year and the grade the
student was in that year.

No students are lost in the process
(except 34 pre-K students that leave in pre-K that JG removes).
    These pre-K students are all
    students from Riverview district that seemed to enter and leave district in
    same year and are not useful for our analysis.

This problem is tricky because students can have multiple observations
per year (multiple grades).
    Left in duplicate records because of grade level errors, we will need to clean
these later.

As for conflicting withdrawals for a student,
    we retained only the most recent withdrawal Date
    and reason. Each of 37,914 students is in table at least once. (JG)
