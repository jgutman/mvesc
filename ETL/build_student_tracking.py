Zhe Overall Note:
   I have not yet checked to ensure the utility functions work
   While this code repeats duplicate rows, I have not yet error checked to
   ensure we didn't lose students in the process (perhaps those
   without a grade or withdrawal code?)

   This SQL code is not great and may not be the best way to do this.
   This problem is tricky because students can have multiple observations
   per year (multiple grades or multiple withdrawals).
'''

'''
Zhe's note is somewhat obsolete now, have tried to deal with some of the issues
he mentions above. We don't lose students in the process, except the 34 students
I chose to remove because they never appear with a grade level. These are all
students from Riverview district that seemed to enter and leave district in
same year, inc. errors, pre-k students, not useful.

Left in duplicate records because of grade level errors, we will need to clean
these later. As for withdrawals, retained only the most recent withdrawal Date
and reason. Each of 37,914 is in table at least once. (JG)
