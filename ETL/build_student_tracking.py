'''
Joint note from JG and ZZ:
This python file generates a SQL query to build a table tracking
students over time. Each column represents a year and the grade the 
student was in that year.

With work from JG, we ensure no students are lost in the process of this
(except 34 pre-K students that leave in pre-K that JG removes).
    These are all
    students from Riverview district that seemed to enter and leave district in
    same year, inc. errors, pre-k students, not useful.
   
This SQL code is not great and may not be the best way to do this.
This problem is tricky because students can have multiple observations
per year (multiple grades).
    Left in duplicate records because of grade level errors, we will need to clean
these later. 

As for withdrawals, retained only the most recent withdrawal Date
and reason. Each of 37,914 is in table at least once. (JG)
