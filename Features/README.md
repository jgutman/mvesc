# Feature Generation Modules

This folder contains the scripts for extracting both features and outcome labels to be used for the prediction problem. These are stored in the database.

### Label/Outcome Definitions

We have several possible definition schemes for choosing outcomes. We create a column for each possible defintion in the database.

(describe the different possible definitions and each one's pros and cons)

### Feature Descriptions

(descriptions of each category of features are described here and points to their respective scripts)
